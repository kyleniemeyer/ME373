MATLAB in Jupyter Notebooks
---------------------------

This course is taught using MATLAB (for now). While you can use the Matlab
application to do everything shown here, in lecture and on this site we'll
use Jupyter notebooks to combine code, results, and prose (text) together.

By default, Jupyter supports Python, R, and Julia, but we can also enable
it to run Matlab code.

We have some guides on getting this set up and using it:

However, this requires some comfort with command-line work, so if this
is a bit beyond your skill level, I recommend just using the Matlab
application.
